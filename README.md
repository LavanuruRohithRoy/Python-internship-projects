# Python Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of console-based Python projects developed as part of an internship learning track.  
Each task is designed to strengthen core Python fundamentals through practical, real-world problem solving.

The projects are implemented incrementally, following a clear and structured development flow.

## Task 01 – To-Do List Application

### Description:
A console-based task management application that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently.  
The program provides options to add new tasks, view existing tasks, update task details, and remove completed tasks through a menu-driven interface.

The project focuses on organizing logic in a clean and readable manner while simulating a basic real-world application workflow.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Lists and dictionaries
- User input handling
- Function-based modular design
- Basic object-oriented concepts
- Separation of data, logic, and user interaction

## Task 02 – Guess the Number Game

### Description:
A console-based number guessing game designed to reinforce Python fundamentals through an interactive experience.  
The program randomly generates a number within a defined range, and the user attempts to guess it.

Based on the user's input, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.  
The application tracks the number of attempts, enforces a maximum guess limit, and allows the user to replay the game.

Special attention is given to handling real-world user input scenarios where input may contain non-numeric characters.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Random number generation
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- User input validation
- String processing
- Function-based program structure
- Program entry point using `main()` and `__name__ == "__main__"`

## Task 03 – File Handling and Text Processing

### Description:
A Python-based program that demonstrates basic file handling operations by reading data from a text file, performing word search and replacement, and saving the updated content back to the file.
The application includes proper exception handling to manage file-related errors gracefully while ensuring reliable and consistent text processing.

The task emphasizes practical usage of file I/O, string manipulation, and error handling in a clean and readable implementation.git

### Key Concepts Covered:
- File input and output operations
- Reading from and writing to text files
- String manipulation and text replacement
- Case-insensitive text processing
- Exception handling for file-related errors
- Dynamic file path handling
- Modular function-based program structure

## Task 04 – Basic Web Scraper

### Description
A console-based Python application that scrapes and displays news headlines from a predefined website.

The program sends an HTTP request to fetch webpage content, parses the HTML structure, extracts relevant data, and presents it in a readable format. This task focuses on understanding web scraping fundamentals and working with real-world HTML data.

### Initial Setup
- Install required dependencies:

- Run the scraper script from the terminal

### Program Flow
1. Send an HTTP request to the target website  
2. Receive and validate the response  
3. Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup  
4. Locate relevant HTML elements containing headlines  
5. Extract and store the text data  
6. Display the extracted information in a formatted console output  

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Python  
- Requests  
- Beautiful Soup (bs4)  

### Key Concepts Covered
- Web scraping fundamentals  
- HTTP request handling  
- HTML parsing basics  
- Data extraction techniques  
- Error handling  
- Function-based modular design  

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates how Python can be used to scrape and process data from web pages while maintaining clean structure, readability, and safe scraping practices.

## Notes
- All projects are intentionally console-based to emphasize core logic over user interface design.
- The code prioritizes clarity, readability, and maintainable structure.
- Each task builds progressively on concepts introduced in previous tasks.

# Python Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of console-based Python projects developed as part of an internship learning track.  
Each task is designed to strengthen core Python fundamentals through practical, real-world problem solving.

The projects are implemented incrementally, following a clear and structured development flow.

## Task 01 – To-Do List Application

### Description:
A console-based task management application that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently.  
The program provides options to add new tasks, view existing tasks, update task details, and remove completed tasks through a menu-driven interface.

The project focuses on organizing logic in a clean and readable manner while simulating a basic real-world application workflow.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Lists and dictionaries
- User input handling
- Function-based modular design
- Basic object-oriented concepts
- Separation of data, logic, and user interaction

## Task 02 – Guess the Number Game

### Description:
A console-based number guessing game designed to reinforce Python fundamentals through an interactive experience.  
The program randomly generates a number within a defined range, and the user attempts to guess it.

Based on the user's input, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.  
The application tracks the number of attempts, enforces a maximum guess limit, and allows the user to replay the game.

Special attention is given to handling real-world user input scenarios where input may contain non-numeric characters.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Random number generation
- Loops (`while`)
- Conditional statements (`if / elif / else`)
- User input validation
- String processing
- Function-based program structure
- Program entry point using `main()` and `__name__ == "__main__"`

## Notes
- All projects are intentionally console-based to emphasize core logic over user interface design.
- The code prioritizes clarity, readability, and maintainable structure.
- Each task builds progressively on concepts introduced in previous tasks.
